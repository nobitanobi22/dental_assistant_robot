Dental Assistant Robot (Vision Robotics Dev) 

Course Project (Python, OpenCV, SolidWorks, Arduino, MATLAB, ROS)

• Built a 5-DOF robotic arm with SolidWorks and Arduino, capable of executing 4+ dental trajectories with >92% positional accuracy using inverse kinematics in MATLAB-Simulink.
• Used tooth & gum segmentation using YOLOv8 on phantom head data, achieving 89% IoU on real-time 3D dental imaging. 
• Integrated real-time control architecture for coordinated motion and vision, with future deployment on embedded vision hardwar
